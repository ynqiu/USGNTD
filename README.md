### Bayesian-CP-Factorization (BCPF)

Source code of unsupervised GNTD and semi-supervised GNTD.

We provide two demo codes: 
`demoUGNTD.m: unsupervised GNTD for image representation. `
`demiSemiGNTD.m: Semi-supervised GNTD for image representation.`

In this package, we used the tensor toolbox 2.6, which is downloaded from (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox)
